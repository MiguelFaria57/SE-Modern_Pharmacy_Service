## Information
This project was divided in 2 parts focused on service design techniques:
- Part 1: apply techniques for diagnosing and evolving services
- Part 2: apply cloud-based technologies to create a simple, powerful, responsive service.

In Part 1, the website "Smaply" was used to create the files.

In Part 2, AWS was used to deploy the website. It was developed using Django, with the help of a Docker container to test the React part of the project.
